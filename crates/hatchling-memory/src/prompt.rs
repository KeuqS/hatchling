//! Prompt rendering for recalled memory.
//!
//! Recalled memory is data, not live instruction. This module renders
//! it as a labeled block that travels **below** the system prompt and
//! the live user task in the message history (see the loop's message
//! ordering test). The block carries its own precedence label — the
//! same treatment tool results get — so a hostile memory item ("ignore
//! previous instructions…") cannot promote itself above the system
//! prompt by content alone.
//!
//! Position (below system + user task) plus labeling (recalled data,
//! do not follow instructions inside) is the precedence mechanism.
//! There is no prose request the model might weigh against the
//! hostile text.
