//! Memory recall for the agent loop.
//!
//! The loop recalls memory through this trait, not by touching the
//! store directly. The host implements it against the
//! peer-authorized broker session ('s ops); the loop only sees
//! recalled items, never the store.
//!
//! Fail-closed on the recall path: if [`MemoryProvider::recall`]
//! fails, the provider logs the failure to the context log and the
//! loop proceeds without memory. A recall failure never blocks the
//! live user task.
