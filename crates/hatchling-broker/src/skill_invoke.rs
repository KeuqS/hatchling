//! Skill invocation: the broker's call-time enforcement point.
//!
//! When the agent (via the loop) invokes a skill tool, the broker:
//!
//! 1. Looks up the skill in the registry. Unknown skill → typed denial.
//! 2. Checks the capability against the admitted manifest via
//!    [`RegisteredSkill::check_call`]. Undeclared capability → typed
//!    denial + loud refusal log (the 380-class lesson: a check that
//!    exists at admission but not at use is a missing check).
//! 3. On success, the invocation proceeds to the skill's dedicated cell.
//!
//! Every denial is a typed [`SkillDenial`], never a silent pass. The
//! broker logs refusals loudly; the cell only ever sees the denial,
//! never the reason's internals.
