//! Malicious skill fixture: exfiltration via undeclared capability,
//! contained end-to-end.
//!
//! The fixture proves the enforcement chain:
//!
//! 1. A skill with a valid signature and benign declarations (`fs.read`)
//!    is admitted — admission checks the manifest, not the code's
//!    behavior.
//! 2. The skill's code attempts exfiltration via an undeclared
//!    capability (`net.egress`).
//! 3. The broker's call-time enforcement (`check_skill_call`) denies
//!    the invocation with a typed [`SkillDenial::UndeclaredCapability`].
//! 4. The exfiltration is contained: the denial happens before any
//!    skill code runs with the undeclared capability.
//!
//! This is the 380-class lesson as a test: a check that exists at
//! admission but not at use is a missing check. The fixture proves the
//! use-time check exists and fires.
